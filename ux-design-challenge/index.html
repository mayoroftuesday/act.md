    <dt>What tasks do I have to do today?</dt>
    <dd>Addition of a new view "Tasks" in the navigation menu. This view will show a list of tasks with descriptions, due dates, who the task is assigned to, and the patient's name. Like the Patients view, due or overdue tasks are labeled in yellow and red, respectively. In this view there are filters for "Show my tasks" and "Due/overdue tasks".</dd>
    <dt>Find patients with specific tasks assigned</dt>
    <dd>Added a text filter to both Patients and Tasks views. This will filter the results based on task descriptions, keywords, etc. Also added a save/load filter component to both pages so users can save the text and checkbox filters for later use. Fitlers will be given unique IDs so they can be emailed/shared with colleagues.</dd>
